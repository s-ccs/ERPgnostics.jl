This is a Julia package that helps to detect patterns in ERP data. 

Imagine you have data with multiple trials and experimental variables. You can sort the trials based on the experimental variables. If there is a relationship between voltage and variables, you can see a pattern in the data. 

Our tool allows you to automatically detect such patterns in multidimensional data.
