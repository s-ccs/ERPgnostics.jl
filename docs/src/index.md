# ERPgnostics Highlights

ERPgnostics allows to describe big EEG datasets with many experimantal variables. 

- **Overview of EEG data.**  ERP gnostics consists of topoplot series and ERP images. By interactively clicking the marker on topoplot you can select experimetnal variable and electrode. They will be presented as ERP image with trials sorted by experimental varaibel  and color showing the voltage over time course. 
- **Pattern decetion.**  The sorting of trials on ERP images may reveal association between sorting variable and ERP comonents. These asssociations could be seen as varaious patterns, f.i. sigmoid or fan. The color of topoplots is representing the probability to observe such patten on ERP image. This is super useful becuase it would be very cumbersome to check them manually. 



# ERPgnostics Highlights

ERPgnostics is a great tool for exploring large EEG datasets with lots of experimental variables.

- **EEG Data Overview.** ERPgnostics lets you interactively explore EEG data through topoplot series and ERP images. By clicking on markers in the topoplot, you can easily select experimental variables and electrodes. The corresponding ERP image will appear, with trials sorted by the chosen variable. The color in the ERP image shows the voltage over time, giving you a clear view of how the electrical activity changes for selected electrode.

- **Pattern Detection.** Sorting trials in the ERP images can reveal interesting associations between experimental variables and ERP components. These associations may show up as patterns, like sigmoidal or fan-shaped trends. The color in the topoplots represents the probability of observing such patterns in the ERP image. This is incredibly helpful, as manually finding these patterns would be time-consuming and tricky.
